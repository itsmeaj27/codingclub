      content: `Here is a complete, clean implementation of **Binary Search**:

### Python Implementation:
\`\`\`python
def binary_search(arr: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found at index mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            
    return -1  # Target not found

# Example usage:
numbers = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]
result = binary_search(numbers, 23)
print(f"Target found at index: {result}")
\`\`\`

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** $O(\\log n)$ because the search space halves every iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ iterative auxiliary memory.

  }

  if (normalized.includes("two sum")) {
    return {
      content: `Here is the optimal $O(n)$ hash-map solution for the **Two Sum** problem:

### Python Implementation:
\`\`\`python
def two_sum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    prev_map = {}  # val -> index
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - num

            return [prev_map[diff], i]
        prev_map[num] = i
        
    return []

# Test:
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
\`\`\`

### Why this is optimal:
- **Time:** $O(n)$ single-pass hash lookup ($O(1)$ average per lookup).
- **Space:** $O(n)$ to store elements in dictionary.`,
